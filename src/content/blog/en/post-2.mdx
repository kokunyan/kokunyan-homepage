After a successful _first week_ learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

auto Non-standard

    The **makes  educated guesses about when to optimize for speed**, legibility, and geometric precision while drawing text. For differences in how this value is interpreted by the browser, see the compatibility table.

optimizeSpeed

_optimizeLegibility_

    The browser emphasizes legibility over rendering speed and geometric precision. This enables kerning and optional ligatures.

geometricPrecision Non-standard

    *The browser emphasizes geometric precision over rendering speed and legibility. Certain aspects of fonts — such as kerning — don't scale linearly. So this value can make text using those fonts look good. In SVG, when text is scaled up or down, browsers calculate the final size of the text (which is determined by the specified font size and the applied scale) and request a font of that computed size from the platform's font system. But if you request a font size of, say, 9 with a scale of 140%, the resulting font size of 12.6 doesn't explicitly exist in the font system, so the browser rounds the font size to 12 instead. This results in stair-step scaling of text.
    But the geometricPrecision property — when fully supported by the rendering engine — lets you scale your text fluidly. For large scale factors, you might see less-than-beautiful text rendering, but the size is what you would expect—neither rounded up nor down to the nearest font size supported by Windows or Linux.*
